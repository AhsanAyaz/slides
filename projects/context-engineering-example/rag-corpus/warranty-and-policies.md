## FAQ - Warranty & Returns

**Q: Can I extend my warranty after purchase?**
A: Yes, but only within the first 30 days of purchase. Log into your account and navigate to your order to add extended warranty.

**Q: What if I lost my receipt?**
A: No problem! If you ordered from our website, we have records. If purchased elsewhere, we can often verify warranty via product serial number.

**Q: Can I return a product after 30 days?**
A: Returns are only accepted within 30 days. After that, warranty coverage applies for defective products, but no refunds for change of mind.

**Q: How do I register my product for warranty?**
A: Warranty is automatically registered when you purchase. No manual registration needed! But you can create an account at starlightproducts.com for easier claim filing.

**Q: Does weather resistance have a separate warranty?**
A: No, it's covered under the standard 2-year warranty. If the IP65 rating fails, it's a warranty issue.

**Q: What if my projector was damaged in shipping?**
A: Contact us immediately (within 48 hours of delivery). We'll ship a replacement unit overnight at no cost. This is separate from the return policy.

**Q: Can I return a projector I used outdoors?**
A: Yes! The 30-day return policy applies even if you've used it. Just clean it before returning and include all accessories.

**Q: Do you offer trade-in credit?**
A: Yes! We offer up to 50% trade-in credit toward a new purchase. Contact our trade-in department for a quote.
