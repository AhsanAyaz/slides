## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use the SP3000 indoors even though it's designed for outdoor use?**
A: Absolutely! The SP3000 works great indoors. The outdoor capability is a bonus, not a limitation. Many customers use it indoors all winter and move it outdoors in summer.

**Q: Is the AB5000 really that much better for indoor use?**
A: It's brighter (4200 vs 3500 lumens) and has more smart features, but most users don't need the extra brightness unless using a very large screen (100+ inches) or watching in a brighter room. The SP3000 is excellent for most indoor setups.

**Q: What about the Galaxy Globe for watching movies?**
A: Not recommended. It's designed for ambiance and education, not entertainment. The projection is too small and dim for movie watching. Stick with SP3000 or AB5000 for movies.

**Q: Which has better picture quality?**
A: Both SP3000 and AB5000 have identical 4K resolution. The AB5000 is brighter, which matters for larger screens or brighter rooms, but picture sharpness and color are comparable.

**Q: Can I return it if I choose wrong?**
A: Yes! We have a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. However, most customers who choose based on their primary use case (outdoor vs indoor) are very satisfied with their choice.
