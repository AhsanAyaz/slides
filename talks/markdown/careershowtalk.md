Notes:

## So how do you really grow your career as a Software Engineer?

&nbsp;

Or in any other profession really. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

![GDE Profile](assets/memes/do-not.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

--

## Why?

###### Because Extermely Fast Career Growth doesn't ensure gaining Mastery <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

![Too Fast](assets/memes/too-fast.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" class="fragment" -->

--

On the other hand, working for years in a company also doesn't ensure you've gained Mastery either.

![Too Slow](assets/memes/too-slow.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" class="fragment" -->

--

## So what do you really do then?

Find a perfect balance

![Balance](assets/memes/balance.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

--

Find a balance between Career Advancement vs Career Progression

---

## Career Advancement
## vs 
## Career Progression

--

## Career Advancement

- Involves Formal Change (job/title) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Often includes a raise in Salary <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Easier to reflect in a Resume <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

## Career Progression

- May or may not involve a job/title switch <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Involves a change in Responsibilities <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Harder to see on a Resume <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Can be reflected by accomplishments <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

## Career Progression often leads to Career Advancement

Both are equally important <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Let me tell you a story

![Oweseme Logo](assets/images/owesome-logo.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px; border-radius: 50%;" class="fragment" -->

I built a product and got incubated in one of the biggest incubators in Karachi, Pakistan.

--

![Owesome Screenshot](assets/images/owesome.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" -->

--

## But I failed!

--

## Is it because I my product was bad or I was a bad Software Engineer?

Nope! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

It is because I was wearing multiple hats in my team!

In fact, all the hats <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


![Multitasking](assets/memes/multitasking.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

--

I was the only one in my team and wanted to be a successful entrepreneur

![Multitasking](assets/memes/alone.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" -->

--

## But was I ready?

- Nope <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- I could've used a team <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- I could've been more competent and experienced <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- I had to support my family and get financially stable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- I should've had more experience myself to lead the product and to make decisions.

---

## But then how should you grow your career?

Slowly? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

Not neccessarily. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

If you're not being promoted or not getting career advancement, that's not good. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Avoid unnecessary career jumps or advancement. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Focus on your career progression as much as possible. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

In short, don't do this

![Obstacles](assets/memes/avoiding-obstacles.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" -->

---

## But then, what should you do?

--

## Network!

![Network](assets/images/network.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

GitHub: @ahsanayaz <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Twitter: @codewith_ahsan <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- Follow influencers and techies on Twitter
- Follow software engineers on GitHub
- Connect with people on LinkedIn

--

## Find a Mentor

![Mentor](assets/images/mentor.jpeg) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

--

## Grow an Audience

![Audience](assets/images/audience.jpeg) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- One of the best ways to progress a career to share knowledge
- That is what has helped me throughout years
- And that is why I created a lot of open-sourced projects, wrote tens of articles and gave 50 talks in the past few years.
- Once you start sharing, you reflect automatically your expertise. That's what companies or recruiters want to see. Right?
- So grow an audience, that'll help you a lot.

--

## Work on stuff to show

![Welcome To My Website](assets/images/welcome-to-my-website.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment fade-in-then-out" --> 

--

![GitHub Portfolio](assets/images/github-portfolio.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 700px;" -->

--

## Promote yourself

- Share your achievements. No matter how small or big
- Use the power of social media

--

## Ask yourself some questions

- Why should a company hire you? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What do you bring to the table? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How can you help the company grow? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## And always remember...

--

![Patch](assets/memes/patch.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" -->

It's not always nice to patch things directly on Production! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
