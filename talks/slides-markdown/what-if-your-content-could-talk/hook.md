Notes:
- What if your content could talk back to your users?
- In this talk, I'll explain how I transformed my Angular Cookbook's site into an interactive, intelligent resource
using Google Gemini and RAG

### When I was a kid, my mother used to buy these small books called Naunihal. I loved them.

<!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- The stories within these books were beyond just words.
- They engaged me
- Sparked curiousity
- And often left me smiling or pondering

### Stories engage us. They shape us

<!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- In the past, stories were told by grandparents or parents, creating a rich, interactive experience. 
- Storytelling is never just one-way—it’s a back-and-forth.

### And what do we do when we are listening to a story?
#### We ask questions
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

<!-- .slide: id="questions-1" -->

### Questions like

- "What happens next?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "Is there a twist in the story?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;
<!-- .slide id="questions-2" -->
- “Why didn’t the rabbit just set an alarm before falling asleep in the tortoise and the hare race?”
<!-- - “Why didn’t SRK pay 50 RS to the conductor and stop the train with an emergency brake?” -->

### Questions are the heart of every story

In every story, we want to know more.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Notes:
- What happens next?
- Why did that happen?


;VS;
<!-- .slide: id="what-if" -->
### What if our websites or content could respond to this curiosity in real-time, just like a storyteller would?

;VS;
<!-- .slide: id="that-is-exactly" -->
### That is exactly what we'll talk about for the rest of this talk
