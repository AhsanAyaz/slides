# What happened after?

;VS;

## I was working on a really cool, large scale project with Angular 2.0

- For about 2.5 years <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- Overcoming technical challenges and embracing learning opportunities <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
- Architecting and leading the team <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

;VS;

And this is how it looked...

![Good2beTrue](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/good2betrue.jpg) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

;VS;

So 2.5 years of work and efforts

But at the end of it... <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

## The project never got live... <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

;VS;

![Scream](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/scream.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

;VS;

As a result I had nothing to show for my portfolio for my 2.5 years of work

;HS;

## However, there was one amazing thing that those 2.5 years gave me

;VS;

## Open Source Contributions

;VS;

### My First Open Source Contribution

- The story behind my [first contribution](https://github.com/rpocklin/angular-timeline/pull/15)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

- The story behind my [second contribution](https://github.com/itsdrewmiller/angular-perfect-scrollbar/pull/68)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

- The story behind my [third contribution](https://github.com/souly1/ng-walkthrough/pull/24)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

- The story behind my [fourth contribution](https://github.com/attribesolution/ng-conf-2016-hackathon-app/pull/3/files)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

## What I did [for more than a year](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz?tab=overview&from=2016-05-01&to=2016-05-31)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

;VS;

## My actual first library ever

## [ng2-emoji](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/ng2-emoji)
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

;HS;

## But then later in November, the Angular 2 project demanded something

## Something that didn't exist
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

;VS;

### A library that could detect if an Angular app is working on a mobile phone, or a desktop device

;VS;

I searched and searched, but there was nothing

![searchfail](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/search-fail.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

;VS;

I could however find [ng-device-detector](https://github.com/srfrnk/ng-device-detector)

![ng-dd](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/ng-dd.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px; object-fit: contain;" -->

;VS;

So just like a good software developer...

I copy pasted
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

![maniac](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/laughing.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" class="fragment" -->

;VS;

![ngx-device-detector](assets/images/ngx-device-detector.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

;VS;

### [ngx-device-detector](https://github.com/ahsanayaz/ngx-device-detector)

- A library people started using over the years
- Still below 500 stars on GitHub <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Not all the code in the repository is mine <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Achieving over [`10 million`](https://github.com/ahsanayaz/ngx-device-detector) installs on npm
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Has had a **great impact** on my career
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;HS;

## This changed my perspective about open source

;VS;

## I realized the following:

- I have been using so many cool libraries for free
- And I don't see any projects from any Pakistanis in the wild that I'm using.

;VS;

## Which was just...

## sad

;VS;

### That was the moment I decided to contribute more to open source, and to spread the expertise I had with the others

;VS;

## So we're not only consumers of tech, but also **creators & contributors** as well. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

## And then I took the following steps:

- Started answering questions on stackoverflow <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Convinced my company to make opensource contributions and tech talks as part of the company's culture <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Started giving talks at small conferences <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Some of the talks were just a big disaster where things didn't really work


;HS;

## And then something happened

;VS;

## I was reached out by this really cool guy named Mashhood Rastagar

![mashhood](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/mashhood.jpeg) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

Notes:
- He was a senior software engineer with a decade of experience
- Inspired me a lot to grow technically
- And he was applying for being a GDE

;VS;

## And he was planning to apply for this thing called Google Developers Expert

Notes:
- I was curios, what is that really? 

;VS;

## I thought to myself... Can I become one too?

## And the brain said 'YES', why not?? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

## Mashhood asked me to build a portfolio and to give it more time

Notes:
- I started applying to even more conferences, learning more, growing my expertise even more
- And after 6-8 months, I asked him to nominate me for the GDE program.

;VS;

## I got the email from Google to fill a form for the nomination including all my impact for the past 3 years

#### as far as I remember

;VS;

## A couple of interviews later, I met Stephen Fluin for my final interview

#### Angular core team at Google

Note:
- Nervous, confused, but aced the interview

;VS;

## But then there was a looooooong wait....

Notes:
- I was basically checking my email every day!

;VS;

## And then one day...

;VS;

## I was accepted in the program

![GDE](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/gde-success.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

;HS;

## But right after

### I felt hollow. Let's talk about why
<!-- {.element class="small"} -->

;VS;

## I needed a bigger goal

;VS;

## And since then, I've been celebrating small wins

;VS;

## That is the way to go

;HS;

## Thank you!
