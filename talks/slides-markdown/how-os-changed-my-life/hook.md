## In 2016 ...

Notes:

- There were many developers who got sad...confused that they learnt a framework for 2 years only to get it nuked!!

;VS;

But many were excited...

I was nobody

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- Among 100 developers. Almost no one knew me. I was a nobody among them.

;VS;

But I was happy...

## During the event, the host gave everyone a task

![task](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/task.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

Notes:
- And the task was related to Angular, to build a small program. I was excited, and wanted to do my best.

;VS;

Even though it wasn't a competition, I raised my hand and told them

"I am done with the task"

;VS;

## And suddenly...

## The host invited me on the stage
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

## "Come up here", he said.
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- I got a bit shocked, and got nervous at the same time.

;VS;

![Walking to the stage](assets/images/how-os-changed-my-life/stage-walk.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

Notes:
- I started walking to the stage. Sweat running down my palms to my laptop, my heart racing. I went to the stage, and explained how I built the program, like it was not a big deal at all. And then I hear it.

;VS;

## Applause by around 100 devs
