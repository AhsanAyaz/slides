## Why should I have an online presence as a developer?

### Isn't being a good developer enough?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

![Too Many](assets/memes/too-many.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 500px;" -->

Notes:
- There are too many devs who are out there in the wild searching for jobs
- Many of them follow the exact tutorials you would've followed
- It is hard to stand out

# It is hard to stand out as a software developer.

;HS;

## So what is the goal really?

- To get people convinced that you're an amazing developer <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- To have recruiters QUICKLY identify you as a good match <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;HS;

## Let's talk about your Portfolio

What is it??

;VS;

- It is your gateway to the recruiters' hearts
- It is your selling document <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- It is the only thing that can SHOWCASE your skills even before you have an interview <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;HS;

## Developers are LAZY!

;VS;

## But if you got the skills

;VS;

## But if you can SHOWCASE the skills

![Checkmark](assets/images/checkmark.png) <!-- .element: class="fragment" style="height: 200px;" -->

;VS;

### This can start your Asynchronous search to finding jobs

## Let's talk about your LinkedIn profile

;VS;

### You may love your LinkedIn profile

And you should <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

## Most Recruiters are Overwhelmed


Notes:
- they don't review each profile
- they SCAN profiles

;VS;

Let's say the recruiter is looking for someone with the following skills:
- NodeJS
- Full Stack
- React
- GCP

;VS;

![Simple Profile 1](assets/images/building-online-presence/simple-linkedin-prof-1.png) 

Notes:
- Are you the one they're looking for?
- Maybe... Maybe not
- Now you rely on THEM reviewing more of your profile

;VS;

And then the recruiter moves to the next profile

![Crying](assets/memes/crying-meme.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

;VS;

Let's say the recruiters gave you a benefit of doubt and moved to your about

;VS;

![Simple Profile 2](assets/images/building-online-presence/linkedin-about.png) 

;VS;

If your about looks like this...
![Frustrated](assets/memes/frustrated.gif) 


;VS;

### Keep your headline & about to showcase:
- Who you are
- What you're doing right now <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Where are you going forward <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

# Showcase your **Skills** <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> & **Passion** <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

At this point, you're expecting the recruiter to put more efforts than what they've put already

;VS;

Have them NOT click the "...see more" button

![See more](assets/images/building-online-presence/see-more.png) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

### If the recruiters are still deperate for getting candidates...

They're looking for:
- When did you start a set of technologies <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Are you still using them <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Have you been consistent <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

![Better Headline](assets/images/building-online-presence/linkedin-good-headline.png) 

;VS;

# Make it EASY for them

;VS;

## Let's say you're *Shortlisted*

;VS;

This means you've got the most boxes ticked

- ✅ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ✅ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

# The game of *Prioritization* starts here

;VS;

### You're probably at the mercy of *Preferred Candidates* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

## So what more can you do to have your LinkedIn profile stand out?

;VS;

- Activity Section
  - Journal your coding journey <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Create small posts <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Talk about how fun itt is what you do daily <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Provide value to others by educating <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

### In short, for LinkedIn:
- Be clear, state the techs you use <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Don't make recruiters read more, or to find information they seek in a difficult way <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Do your best to pass this pre-interview phase <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Show your passion.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - You don't work with tech, you live and breathe it <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


;VS;

## Your profile/CV doesn't have to *Fancy*, it has to be *Convincing* 

;HS;

# Let's talk about GitHub Profiles

;VS;

Dan Abramov (Redux's Author)

![Dan Github](assets/images/building-online-presence/dan-github.png) 

;VS;

My GitHub

![Ahsan Github 1](assets/images/building-online-presence/ahsan-github-1.png) 

;VS;

![Ahsan Github 2](assets/images/building-online-presence/ahsan-github-2.png) 

;VS;

## What do you need to have on your GitHub?

;VS;

# Side Projects

;VS;

Side projects need:

![Time Effort Drive](assets/images/building-online-presence/time-effort-drive.png) 

;VS;

![Projects Died](assets/images/building-online-presence/projects-died.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 600px;" -->

;VS;

# Todo apps are NOT enough

;VS;

## From you GitHub projects, how do you show that:
- You've got skills for a particular tech stack <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- You've worked with other people <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- You've worked on a large project <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- You've worked with great coding standards <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

# OpenSource contributions are !important

;VS;

## Use LinkedIn activitiy to share about your projects

- Share about what you built <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What challenges you faced <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What you enjoyed about the whole experience <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Keep it short <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;VS;

## Have an *Active* GitHub profile instead of a *Perfect* one

Notes:
- You don't need a profile with exceptional coding standards all the time
- But you need an active github profile with some quality projects

;VS;

Small contributions like fixing typos, creating issues, picking 'good first issues' are great starting points

;VS;

## Have a GREAT Readme file

;VS;

### [A *good* Readme example](https://github.com/koderlabs/ngx-device-detector)

;VS;

### [A *bad* Readme example](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/node-redis-auth)

;VS;

### [Awesome Readme Examples](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)

;VS;

## If you build something using a tutorial

- It is good, it teaches you stuff
- Add more features to it
- Make it your own (style it)
- Deploy your apps. Make them publicly accessible
- Add the links your projects in your CV and on LinkedIn (Featured)

;HS;

## Use LinkedIn's [Media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahsanayaz/details/experience/) Section

;HS;

# Am I making this all up?

<small>I could be lying. Do I have any data?</small> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

"[CleverProgrammer](https://www.youtube.com/@CleverProgrammer) (1.2M subs) used my project DeveloperFolio in a closed group

[Kent C Doods](https://github.com/kentcdodds) tweeted about my project [React Blog GitHub](https://github.com/saadpasta/react-blog-github)

And my GitHUb projects were the trending projects on GitHub under the javascript tag for some days. (I posted it on linkedin all the time)"

;HS;

## More Data?

I asked in the Pakistani's in EU Tech Group about this

## How to get in the habit of maintaining an online presence?

;VS;

## Network!

![Network](assets/images/network.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

GitHub: @ahsanayaz <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Twitter: @codewith_ahsan <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- Follow influencers and techies on Twitter
- Follow software engineers on GitHub
- Connect with people on LinkedIn

;VS;

## Find a Mentor

![Mentor](assets/images/mentor.jpeg) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

;VS;

## Grow an Audience

![Audience](assets/images/audience.jpeg) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- One of the best ways to progress a career to share knowledge
- That is what has helped me throughout years
- And that is why I created a lot of open-sourced projects, wrote tens of articles and gave 50 talks in the past few years.
- Once you start sharing, you reflect automatically your expertise. That's what companies or recruiters want to see. Right?
- So grow an audience, that'll help you a lot.

;VS;

## Work on stuff to show

![Welcome To My Website](assets/images/welcome-to-my-website.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" class="fragment fade-in-then-out" --> 

;VS;

![GitHub Portfolio](assets/images/github-portfolio.png) <!-- .element: style="height: 700px;" -->

;VS;

## Promote yourself

- Share your achievements. No matter how small or big
- Use the power of social media

;VS;

## Ask yourself some questions

- Why should a company hire you? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What do you bring to the table? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How can you help the company grow? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;HS;

## And always remember...

;VS;

![Patch](assets/memes/patch.gif) <!-- .element: style="height: 400px;" -->

It's NOT always nice to patch things directly on Production!
