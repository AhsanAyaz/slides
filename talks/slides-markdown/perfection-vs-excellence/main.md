Notes:
- Following the Battle of Yamama, where a substantial number of Quran memorizers were killed, a concern arose about preserving the complete Quranic revelation. 
- Caliph Abu Bakr tasked Zaid ibn Thabit, a trusted scribe, to compile the Quran from various sources, including verified written fragments and the memories of companions.

The Battle of Constantinople showcases a prioritization of excellence over perfection in several ways:

- Focus on Strategy over Strength <!-- .element class="fragment" style="font-size: 24px;" -->

- Tactics over Ideal Execution <!-- .element class="fragment" style="font-size: 24px;" -->

- Process over Immediate Victory <!-- .element class="fragment" style="font-size: 24px;" -->

- Adaptability and Ingenuity  <!-- .element class="fragment" style="font-size: 24px;" -->

Notes:
- The Ottoman navy was not perfect or strong enough to break through Byzantine defenses directly. Instead of waiting to build a flawless fleet, Sultan Mehmed II leveraged strategic innovation, transporting ships overland on greased logs to bypass the Golden Horn’s formidable chain barrier.
- The maneuver of hauling ships over land was not flawless or conventional—it was bold, practical, and effective. The focus was on achieving the objective of gaining control over the harbor, even if the method wasn’t ideal.
- Mehmed II demonstrated patience and adaptability, coordinating multiple strategies over weeks rather than seeking a quick, perfect attack. This included using cannons to weaken the city walls and applying consistent pressure across different fronts.
- The decision to adapt to challenges, whether through engineering innovations or tactical adjustments, prioritized practical outcomes. The Ottomans improvised and used the resources available, even if the tools and methods were not perfect.
